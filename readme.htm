<p>
    This small game was written as a solution for Remote Task of <a href="http://xpn.com.ua/">XPN</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Main character has few lives that can be lost when meeting with enemy.
    The goal is to collect all coins and not to lose all lives.

<p>
    However, game controls can be customized using game configuration files.
</p>

<p>
    If you are advanced user and you want to customize game (that can be done very easily
    since game was designed to be customizable) start from config.xml file
    and use technical documentation to figure out parameters' purposes (though all parameters
    are enough self-documenting and self-describing). Game assets file (Assets.paf) is a zip
    archive with password "VidIvDiefboiljIlcofs".

<h2>Warning!</h2>

<p>
    If you are developer then you should know that this application uses modified version of Irrlicht 1.7.2!
    Details can be found at Irrlicht/Changes/readme.txt.
</p>

<h2>Additional notes</h2>

<p>In order to build application you should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>open Pathman.sln in Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (Express Edition) or above;</li>
    <li>choose Release build configuration;</li>
    <li>build solution;</li>
    <li>pack assets:
        <ol class="sublist">
            <li>if you have installed 7-Zip then run PackAssets.bat;</li>
            <li>
                otherwise change attribute "Path" of the "assets" element in the config.xml
                from "Assets.paf" to "./Assets/" (that will instruct Pathman to use unpacked
                assets).
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
